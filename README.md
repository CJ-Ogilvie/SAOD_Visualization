AOD data visualization web app. Created by C.J. Ogilvie under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Toohey at the University of Saskatchewan.

AOD_Web_App.py is the core of this project. It reads atmospheric data, and produces the file AOD_Web_App.html, which contains the entire set of interactive plots for the datasets.

AOD_Web_App.py reads the files from the processed_data/ folder. If any files are missing, it will read the raw data from the data/ folder, and generate the processed data files.

The index.html file is used to generate the github pages site demonstrating the app online.
